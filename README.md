# Custom Shell in C

They don’t call C the mother of languages for nothing. That's why I’m diving headfirst into this powerful language to learn, master, and ultimately create something cool—a custom shell. This project will serve as both a learning experience and a practical tool to explore how operating systems work under the hood.

## Why C?

C is often referred to as the "mother of all languages," and for good reason. It’s the foundation of many modern languages and operating systems. By building a custom shell in C, I’ll get hands-on experience with system-level programming, processes, memory management, and much more. This shell will be simple at first but will grow with new features, all the while honing my skills in C.

## Features

- **Command Prompt**: Displaying a basic shell prompt (`myshell>`).
- **Command Execution**: Ability to run external commands and programs.
- **Built-in Commands**: Implementing commands like `cd` (change directory) and `exit`.
- **Process Management**: Using `fork()` and `execvp()` to create child processes and execute commands.
- **Signal Handling**: Gracefully handling user interrupts (Ctrl+C).

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to start contributing and playing with the project:


## Roadmap

1. Learn C basics and understand how processes work.
2. Implement the command prompt and basic command parsing.
3. Build the core functionalities of the shell: command execution, process management, and built-ins.
4. Expand with features like piping, redirection, and job control.
5. Add more advanced functionalities, like command history and custom signal handling.

Feel free to contribute, fork, or simply watch the project as I build it out!
